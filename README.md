# Objectives:
Create a website with timeline/gantt chart and update logs for individual programs we are tracking


## Gantt charts:
* Should be editable on the webpage itself by authorized user. Editable features should include:
* Adding/deleting more tests/tasks in between two tasks
* Changing start time/ end time/ dependencies
* Automatically detecting critical path and highlighting themÂ 
* Change in overall timeline should automatically trigger emails to broader group.


## Update logs
* A table showing different range affecting updates to the program.
* This table should be editable on the webpage itself by the authorized user
* Updates should be automatically emailed to range team only.
* Publish on/off button/toggle: Should be modifiable by authorized user only.
* Website should also have a timeline/gantt chart showing just the major milestones of each project in a single graph
* This graph should not be editable, rather it should pick up the milestone dates from individual program webpages/backend.
